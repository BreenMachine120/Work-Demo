# Brick Breaker

This program is a game of Brick Breaker in Python, which uses an object-oriented graphics library. The player controls a paddle on the bottom of the screen, and uses it to bounce a ball in motion towards a series of bricks at the top of the screen. If the ball strikes one of the bricks, it is 'broken' and dissapears. The ball bounces off of the paddle, bricks, sides, and top of the canvas. The game is won if all of the bricks are broken. The game is lost if the ball passes the paddle and hits the bottom of the canvas.
