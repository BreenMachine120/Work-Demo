# Battleship placement

Your are tasked with creating an application for the famous game "Battleship." In your version the computer will by playing the user. The user can place their ships but the computer needs to place their ships randomly so that they are hard to guess. An integer matrix should be used to track where the ships are located. Zeros should be used for empty positions on the matrix and ones should be used for spaces where a ship is located. Ships are different sizes (5 , 4, 3, 3, 2 spaces) and must be separated by at least one zero. They also cannot be place on a diagonal. Write a method that takes in an n by n integer matrix of zeros and randomly places all 5 ships according to the rules.

Given a zero matrix of size n by n:

11 x 11

	{{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}}




The method should return a matrix of the same size with ones showing where the ships are located:

	{{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0},
	{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
	{0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0}}


# Binary Search

The binary search is commonly used to quickly search sorted lists in Computer Science. Since we haven't formally learned any list like data structures in CS213 we will binary search the alphabet as a string. Read more about binary search [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/). Write a function that accepts a char "search",the value that we will search for, and String "alpha" – a list of all lowercase letters in the alphabet in acending order without any spaces. This function would then do a binary search on the string alpha and return the charecter if it exists in alpha.


#### Hints:
	- Think recursion
	- Use ASCII values by doing an int cast on a charecter


# Parentheses alignment

Write a program that only accepts strings that consists of matching parentheses: ( ) ,{ } or [ ]. A pair of matching parentheses can be nested/contained within another matching pair. 

For example {[]}, {{()}} are acceptable but [{]} is not.



	INPUT: Enter string? (}]                        
	OUTPUT: false
 
	INPUT:  Enter expression? ({}[{}])()	
	OUTPUT: true
 
	INPUT: Enter string? (}))
	OUTPUT: false
 
	INPUT:  Enter expression? ({}[{}])
	OUTPUT: true
 
	INPUT: Enter string? ((}[])
	OUTPUT: false


# Problem 3. First duplicate

The program generates 10 random digits (0-9). Find the number with its 2nd appearance (duplicate) that shows up soonest in the array. The program asks if you want to repeat it.
Examples.
 
	217868491 
	Result: 8 
	More(y/n)? y 
	
	874906174 
	Result: 7
	More(y/n)? y

	032715538
	Result: 5 
	More(y/n)? n
    

# Same neighbors in a matrix
 
Fill a matrix size n x n (where n, 3 <= n < =10) with uppercase random letters from the English alphabet and print the matrix. Then print only the letters that have similar neighbors as themselves (that is the same letter repeated on the same row, column or diagonal) and for instead for rest of the letters display ‘-‘. If there is no such solution the program prints a matrix with only ‘-‘. The program asks if you want to repeat it.

Examples.

	Size matrix? 3 	
	FFI
	JJW
	LEG
	
	FF-
	JJ-
	---
 
	More(y/n) ? y 

	Size matrix? 4 
	PAMN
	BCQJ 
	MIYZ
	ITPH

	----
	----
	-I--
	 I---

	More(y/n)? n
